# E.D.A (Elite Dangerous Assistant)
Companion app for Elite Dangerous providing various features such as better bookmark management, eddb queries in app, and material tracking.

# The Vision of E.D.A.

While developing I am focusing on these main points:

<ul>
<li> Skinned to look almost just like ED in game UI's.</li>
<li> Customizable. Colors of the UI will be customizable to match your in game UI.
<li> Immersive. Interacting with components within the app will respond just like the in game UI's (such as sounds) and the window will appear in game.</li>
<li> Productive and useful. Providing all the features of our favorite ED resources (EDDB, EDEngineer), plus custom features such as the BBMM (Better bookmark module).</li>
<li> Support. Controller support built in allowing various keybinds to be bound to buttons on your flight stick.</li>
</ul>

# Planned Features
Besides the few features mentioned above, the following are planned.

<ul>
<li> Querie EDDB for specific information directly from within E.D.A. </li>
<li><b>EMTM</b>. Engineering material tracker module. Automatically records and tracks materials gathered. Provides utilities such as in game overlay to easily keep track of your material goals.</li>
<li><b>BBMM</b>. Better bookmark module. Allows you to create bookmarks of systems directly from the game. E.D.A. will populate those bookmarks with relevant and easy to read information. Clicking on the bookmark in app will display more information about the system. </li>
<li><b>NSSM</b>. Nearby star system module. While patrolling the galaxy, E.D.A. will intelligently search for nearby systems that match certain criteria (if you have specified such criteria), and display them in a non-intrusive overlay in game. Allowing you easily plot your next destination for your goals.</li>
<li><b>SYM</b>. Shipyard module. Customize your ships in app to see stat changes to more easily plan your next goal for modifying your ships. </li>
<li><b>GMM</b>. Galatic Market module. Displays prices of sought after resources and nearest systems to obtain and sell those resources.</li>
</ul>

# Features I want to add but may not happen

<ul>
<li><b>SMM</b>. Star map module. Displays the galatic map in app. Probably not useful but would be cool. </li>
<li> Stream deck support. I've investigated this a bit and current libaries do not support the 15 key Streamdeck. </li>
</ul>

# Things you should know

E.D.A is in very early development. At the time of writing (December 2nd, 2020), very little has been implemented besides the basics to get controller support working and how the window will be designed. This is a large project to take on for one person and as I have a full time job and a son to watch after, development may be slow. There is also a lot for me to learn, as programming is a hobby and not something I've devoted to getting an education for. That said, anyone is welcome to help with development.

# Feature requests

I will take feature requests for E.D.A. If you have an awesome idea you'd like to see implemented, or if you think a feature implemented could be better (or thrown away, be honest), please let me know. I'm developing this for the ED community. Let's make this great together.
